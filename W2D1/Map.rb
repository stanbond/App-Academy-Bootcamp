# Our Map class should have the following instance methods: 
# set(key, value), 
# get(key), 
# delete(key), 
# show. 
# Note that the set method can be used to either create a 
# new key-value pair or 
# update the value for a pre-existing key. 
# It's up to you to check whether a key currently exists!
